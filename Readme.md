- **Ethical Text Filtering**:
  - The agent uses ASI-1 Mini to perform ethical checks on user-submitted text, ensuring that all interactions adhere to predefined ethical guidelines.
- **Celebrity-Style Text Generation**:
  - The agent generates personalized, celebrity-style responses using ASI-1 Mini's advanced language modeling capabilities.
- **Voice Synthesis**:
   - The `waver_generate_sound` function integrates the **F5-TTS model** (sourced from Hugging Face and GitHub under the MIT license) to convert text into a realistic celebrity voice.
- **Multi-Step Task Execution**:
  - The agent performs multi-step workflows, including ethical checks, text generation, and voice synthesis, ensuring seamless task execution.
- **Memory and Context Awareness**:
  - The agent stores and retrieves past interactions using a database, enabling personalized and context-aware responses.
- **ChatProtocol Integration**:
  - The agent uses `ChatProtocol v0.3.0` to handle structured conversational workflows, including message acknowledgments and multi-turn dialogues.

- Dependency management and packaging handled with `poetry`.
- Includes a `test.py` script for testing and validation.

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies using `poetry install`.

2. Create .env and fill following this structure:
```bash
    ASI1_API_KEY="key_to_asi:one_ai"
    SEED="123456"
```

3. Run the agent: 
```bash
    poetry run python agent.py
```

4. Use test.py to test:
```bash
    poetry run python test.py
```
